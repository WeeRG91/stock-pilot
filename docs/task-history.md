## Task 01 — Development Environment & Symfony Initialization

Date: 2026-10-22

### Completed

- Verified PHP, required extensions, Composer, Git, and Symfony CLI.
- Created a minimal Symfony 7.4.21 LTS backend.
- Selected Herd PHP 8.3.22 through the root .php-version file.
- Inspected the generated application structure and console commands.
- Started the development server and viewed the Symfony welcome page.
- Initialized one Git repository at the StockPilot root on main.
- Verified ignore rules for dependencies, runtime files, and local overrides.
- Added Composer project metadata and synchronized the lock file.

### Verification

All checks below were executed by the learner and reviewed in chat:

- Symfony requirements checker: passed.
- Composer platform requirements: passed.
- Symfony console about and list: passed.
- Development server: running with PHP 8.3.22.
- Browser: Symfony welcome page displayed.
- Composer strict validation: passed.
- YAML lint: all 6 files passed.
- Service container lint: passed.
- No nested backend Git repository.

No automated application tests have been introduced or executed yet.

### Decisions and limitations

- Separate Symfony backend and future Next.js frontend.
- Minimal skeleton; dependencies will be introduced progressively.
- Shared .env files contain safe defaults; local overrides are ignored.
- Optional realpath_cache_size recommendation remains unchanged.
- No database, frontend, authentication, or business endpoints yet.

### Next steps

- Agree on Task 02 before starting further implementation.
